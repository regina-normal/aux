5.1:

Regina for iPad now supports Python!  Press the [>_] button in the top-right corner for direct access to Regina's mathematical engine.

This release is a major overhaul for Python users:

– All of the code that was deprecated in version 5.0 has now been removed entirely.  See http://regina-normal.github.io/regina4to5.html for instructions on how to update your scripts.

– Many class names have changed, but most of these changes follow a standard pattern (classes of the form NFoo become Foo).  The old class names have been kept, and will not be removed until Regina 6.0.  See http://regina-normal.github.io/regina5to6.html for details.

– More of Regina's triangulation code is now generic, which means you can do more with higher-dimensional triangulations (e.g., triangulate boundary components, or compute homology).

This release also includes minor enhancements to the mathematics and the user interface (e.g., syntax highlighting for script packets, and the ability to cancel long Turaev-Viro calculations).

5.0:

Regina 5.0 is out!

This release includes 4-manifolds and normal hypersurfaces, tree
decompositions, simplification via the Pachner graph, and exact
Turaev-Viro invariants.  There are also many optimisations under the hood.

If you want more, you can download the desktop version from
regina.sourceforge.net – this includes basic support for manifolds of
dimension 5–15, and a major overhaul of the API for C++ and Python programmers.

4.96.2:

Added support for viewing face pairing graphs.
