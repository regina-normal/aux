libvirt over TLS:
- Set up certificates in /etc/pki/ as in https://libvirt.org/tlscerts.html
- Mask all libvirt*.socket units in systemd, so that TLS is enabled
- Edit /etc/default/libvirtd to enable --listen
- Edit /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf to set listen_addr to 127.0.0.1

Jenkins:
- Configure clouds as QEMU, no credentials (but this is not using TLS?)
