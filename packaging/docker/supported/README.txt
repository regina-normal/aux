The files in this directory list the versions of each GNU/Linux distribution
that these docker scripts support on x86_64.  For other architectures, we
typically support a subset of this list.

Each *.list is designed to be machine-readable (and in particular, suitable
for use with for loops in bash).

Rolling distributions (such as arch and debian/sid) are not listed here.
