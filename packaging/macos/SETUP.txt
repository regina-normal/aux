PACKAGING SUMMARY
-----------------

The macOS app bundle is now exclusively built through Xcode, since this
causes much less drama in bundling frameworks, code signing, notarising,
etc., as Apple's security requirements change over time.

To build macOS binaries for distribution:

- Apply the relevant patches from patches/ (the choice of patches differs
  according to whether you are distributing through the Regina website
  or the Mac App Store).  DO NOT COMMIT THESE CHANGES TO GIT.

- Select the macOS scheme and build an archive. Check that the archive
  includes both x86_64 and arm64 binaries, submit it for notarisation,
  and then export the resulting notarised Regina.app to the hard drive.

- Move into this directory and run: ./dmg_maker.py path/to/Regina.app

-----------
OTHER NOTES
-----------

To find all signing identities:

    security find-identity -v -p codesigning

1. Create an installer ISO from the installer app:

  hdiutil create -o /tmp/Ventura.cdr -size 14g -layout SPUD -fs HFS+J
  hdiutil attach /tmp/Ventura.cdr.dmg -noverify -mountpoint /Volumes/install_build
  sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Ventura.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/install_build
  hdiutil detach /Volumes/Install\ macOS\ Ventura
  hdiutil convert /tmp/Ventura.cdr.dmg -format UDTO -o Ventura.iso
  rm /tmp/Ventura.cdr.dmg
  mv Ventura.iso.cdr Ventura.iso

2. Boot from the ISO and run the GUI installer.
