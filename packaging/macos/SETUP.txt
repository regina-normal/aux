Building the MacOS bundle for x86_64 (we no longer support 32-bit machines):

The runtime bundle stands alone, but to build you still need fink installed.
Build-dependencies include:

  Nokia's standalone Qt install

  Fink packages:
    boost1.46.1.cmake
    cmake
    cppunit1.12.1
    doxygen
    gmp5
    libsource-highlight4
    libxml2
    libxslt-bin
    popt

To configure:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/install/location
    -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python
    -DREGINA_INSTALL_TYPE=Bundle
    ..

Then:

  make
  make test ARGS=-V
  make install

At this point the bundle Regina.app should be ready in the install location.
