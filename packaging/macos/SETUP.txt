Building the MacOS bundle:

The runtime bundle stands alone, but to build you still need fink installed.
Build-dependencies include:

  boost1.46.1.cmake
  cmake
  cppunit1.12.1 (or cppunit1.10.2 until 1.12.1 is pushed into fink stable)
  doxygen
  gmp5
  libiconv-dev
  libxml2
  popt

Standalone build-dependencies (from outside fink) include:

  Qt for MacOS

To configure:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/install/location
    -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python
    -DREGINA_INSTALL_TYPE=Bundle
	-DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=path/to/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/4.8.0/gcc/bin/qmake
	..

Then:

  make
  make install

At this point the bundle Regina.app should be ready in the install location.

To create a very basic DMG for shipping:

  hdiutil create -srcfolder Regina.app Regina.dmg

TODO: Nathan knows how to customise the DMG; put the details in this
packaging directory.
