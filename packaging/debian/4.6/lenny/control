Description: 3-manifold topology software with normal surface support
 Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
 It focuses upon the study of 3-manifold triangulations and includes
 support for normal surfaces and angle structures.
 .
 Highlights of Regina include triangulation analysis and simplification,
 census creation and normal surface enumeration.  It offers embedded
 Python scripting giving full access to the calculation engine.
 .
 This package includes the KDE user interface and the command-line
 Python interface, as well as the users' handbook.  For the Python
 reference (i.e., the API documentation for the Regina calculation
 engine), see the package regina-normal-doc.
 .
 Components of Regina that are designed to run on clusters are no longer
 shipped in this package.  They can now be found in the separate package
 regina-normal-mpi.

Description: development files for Regina, the 3-manifold topology software
 Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
 This package provides development files for compiling the Regina
 calculation engine into other projects.
 .
 The calculation engine is provided as a C++ shared library.  For complete
 API documentation, see the package regina-normal-doc.
 .
 Highlights of Regina include triangulation analysis and simplification,
 census creation and normal surface enumeration.

Description: MPI utilities for Regina, the 3-manifold topology software
 Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
 This package contains the components of Regina that are designed to
 run large parallel computations on a cluster using MPI.
 .
 These components have been built against the MPICH implementation of
 MPI.  This means that they must be run under the MPICH runtime environment
 (and not LAM).  The MPICH runtime environment can be found in the
 package mpich-bin.
 .
 The standard components of Regina, including the graphical user interface
 and users' handbook, can be found in the separate package regina-normal.
 .
 Highlights of Regina include triangulation analysis and simplification,
 census creation and normal surface enumeration.
