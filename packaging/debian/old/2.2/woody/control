Description: Regina, the 3-manifold normal surface theory calculator
 Regina is a topological calculator with a bent towards normal surface
 theory. It allows 3-manifolds to be created, manipulated and their
 properties of interest determined. 
 .
 Highlights of Regina include triangulation analysis and simplification,
 census creation and normal surface calculation.  It offers embedded
 Jython scripting giving full access to the calculation engine.

Description: Regina CORBA server for normal surface theory calculator
 Regina is a normal surface theory calculator for 3-manifold
 topologists.  This package provides the calculation engine as a CORBA
 server.
 .
 The Regina user interface is written entirely in Java and can be run on
 a different machine (and under a different operating system).  It can
 call upon this CORBA server to do all of its mathematical work.
 .
 If you have package regina-normal installed you probably don't need
 this; regina-normal provides the calculation engine as a native JNI
 library that is faster and safer (but can only be accessed by the user
 interface on this machine).
 .
 Highlights of Regina include triangulation analysis and simplification,
 census creation and normal surface calculation.  It offers embedded
 Jython scripting giving full access to the calculation engine.
