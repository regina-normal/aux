regina-normal (2.3-0.sarge.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt for sarge.
  * Now builds against j2se1.4 (not j2se1.3).  This requires applying the
    getUI() -> getPacketUI() patch from git commit ad976ad25d (17 Jun 2002).
  * Explicitly builds using g++-2.95 (since this regina is too old to build
    against g++-3.3, which is the default in sarge).
  * Removed the CORBA server, and therefore the entire regina-normal-server
    binary package.  This is because we cannot link regina's g++-2.95 engine
    with the g++-3.3 omniORB4 libraries shipped with sarge.  Any attempt to
    reinstate regina-normal-server would need to happen on woody, which
    shipped with omniORB3 and used g++-2.95 as the default compiler.
