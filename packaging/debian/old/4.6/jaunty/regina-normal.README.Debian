Regina for Ubuntu
-----------------

Two main binaries are provided with Regina:

- /usr/bin/regina-kde, which starts the KDE user interface;
- /usr/bin/regina-python, which starts a command-line Python session.

Several other specialised binaries are also provided; see the users'
handbook for details.

The users' handbook is provided with this package and can be viewed in
the KDE Help Centre, or by entering the URL 'help:/regina/' directly
into konqueror.

Sample topology data files and sample Python sessions are provided in
the directory /usr/share/doc/regina-normal/examples/.

If you are using Python scripting or if you are building the Regina
calculation engine into your own projects, you will probably want the
calculation engine API documentation.  This is provided in the separate
package regina-normal-doc.

Headers and other development files required for building Regina's C++
calculation engine into your own projects are provided by the package
regina-normal-dev.

Components of Regina that are designed to run on clusters can be found
in the separate package regina-normal-mpi.
