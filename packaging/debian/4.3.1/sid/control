Description: 3-manifold topology software with normal surface support
 Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
 It focuses upon the study of 3-manifold triangulations and includes
 support for normal surfaces and angle structures.
 .
 Highlights of Regina include triangulation analysis and simplification,
 census creation and normal surface enumeration.  It offers embedded
 Python scripting giving full access to the calculation engine.
 .
 This package includes the KDE user interface and the command-line
 Python interface, as well as the users' reference manual.  For the
 Python reference (i.e., the API documentation for the Regina
 calculation engine), see the package regina-normal-doc.
