Regina Development Files for Debian
-----------------------------------

The Regina calculation engine is provided in the static C++ library
/usr/lib/libregina-engine.a.  The corresponding headers can be found
in /usr/include/regina-normal/.

The calculation engine will not be provided as a shared library until
its API settles somewhat.

Thorough documentation for the calculation engine can be found in
package regina-normal-doc.
