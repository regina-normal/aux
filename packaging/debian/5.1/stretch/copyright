  SNAPPEA AND SNAPPY:

  Regina includes portions of the SnapPea kernel and its successor SnapPy,
  which it uses for some geometric calculations.  The SnapPea kernel was
  originally written by Jeff Weeks.  SnapPy, where this kernel is now
  maintained, is primarily developed by Marc Culler and Nathan Dunfield,
  with contributions from many people.  SnapPy and the corresponding SnapPea
  kernel are distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
  version 2 or any later version, as published by the Free Software Foundation.


  NORMALIZ LIBRARY:

  Regina includes a copy of libnormaliz, which it uses to help with the
  enumeration of fundamental normal surfaces.  Normaliz was written by Winfried
  Bruns, Bogdan Ichim and Christof Soeger.  It is distributed under the terms of
  the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
  either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.


  ORB KERNEL:

  Regina includes snippets of code from Orb, for use in importing and
  exporting files in Orb / Casson format.  Orb is based on SnapPea
  (see above) with additional code written by Damian Heard, who has also
  given permission for his code to be distributed under the terms of the
  GNU General Public License.
