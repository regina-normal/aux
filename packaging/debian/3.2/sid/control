Description: Regina, the 3-manifold normal surface theory calculator
 Regina is a topological calculator with a bent towards normal surface
 theory. It allows 3-manifolds to be created, manipulated and their
 properties of interest determined. 
 .
 Highlights of Regina include triangulation analysis and simplification,
 census creation and normal surface enumeration.  It offers embedded
 Jython scripting giving full access to the calculation engine.
 .
 Note that this package requires a Java virtual machine that has been
 built using gcc3.  As of June 2003 the unofficial Debian packages for
 Java 1.4 are still built using gcc2, which causes Regina (and other JNI
 apps) to crash unexpectedly.  A gcc3 build of Java 1.4 can be downloaded
 directly from www.blackdown.org; see
 /usr/share/doc/regina-normal/README.Debian for details of how to use a
 locally installed Java virtual machine with Regina.
