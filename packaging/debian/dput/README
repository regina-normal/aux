This is the debian package upload tool, or dput. dput has been developed
because dupload, the only tool for doing uploads, has quite
a few open bug reports and the code is in my opinion not very clean. 

So I decided to start again and create a new tool for uploading packages
into debian.  This tool is dput, which will include more features
and be (hopefully) bug free. It is written in python, since the author
believes that python is a very good language. 

The features include: 
* Test of the GnuPG signature on the dsc-File
* Verification of the check sums in the dsc-File.
* Support for md5 and sha check sums.
* Check for unnecessary .tar.gz's or missing .tar.gz's
* Running lintian before putting the package into the archive
* Running dinstall after the package is in the archive and making sure that
  the package will be put on the correct server.
* Running user-defined commands before and after an upload.

A lot of the tests can be run without really putting the package
into the archive. 

If you are still using PGP instead of GnuPG, please consider switching to
GnuPG instead. You can find a Howto about "Replacing PGP 2.x with GnuPG" at
the following URL: http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/pgp2x.html

This tool is released under the GPL and a copy of this license can be 
found at /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL.
