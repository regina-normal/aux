.SH NAME
.B dput.cf
\- Debian package upload tool configuration file

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manpage gives a brief overview of dput's configuration file and the
available options in it.
\fBdput\fP is a tool to upload Debian packages to the archive.
.PP

.SH FORMAT
dput.cf consists of different groups of configuration options, one for each
host where you want to be able to upload packages. Hosts are defined using an
identifier header with a short name for the host, enclosed in square brackets.
Note that only if multiple such headers are encountered in the
configuration, only the group following the last header is considered. This
is done to avoid confusion when overriding a global configuration file with
a user-specific one.
There's a special identifier, [DEFAULT], which holds default parameters for
all the hosts. The defaults can be overridden by redefining them again in
each host section. The available parameters are listed below:
.TP
.B fqdn
This is the fully qualified domain name that will be used (can be specified
as host:port for HTTP, HTTPS and FTP).
.TP
.B login
Your login on the machine named before. A single asterisk \fB*\fR will
cause the scp and rsync uploaders to not use supply a login name when
calling to ssh, scp, and rsync.
.TP
.B incoming
The directory that you should upload the files to.
.TP
.B method
The method that you want to use for uploading the files.
Currently, dput accepts the following values for \fBmethod\fR:
.RS
.TP
.I ftp
the package will be uploaded via ftp, either anonymously or using a
login/password. Note that ftp is unencrypted so you should not use
password authentication with this.
.TP
\fIhttp\fR and \fIhttps\fR
the package will be uploaded via http or https using the PUT method
as specified in WebDAV. The upload method will prompt for a password
if necessary.
.TP
.I scp
the package will be uploaded using ssh's scp. This transfers files using a
secure ssh tunnel, and needs an account on the upload machine.
.TP
.I rsync
the package will be uploaded using rsync over ssh. This is similar to scp,
but can save some bandwidth if the destination file already exists on the
upload server. It also needs a login on the remote machine as it uses ssh.
.TP
.I local
the package will be "uploaded" locally using /usr/bin/install.  This
transfers files to a local incoming directory, and needs appropriate
permissions set on that directory.
.RE
.TP
.B hash
The hash algorithm that should be used in calculating the checksum of
the files before uploading them. Currently, dput accepts the following values
for \fBhash\fR:
.RS
.TP
.I md5
use the md5 algorithm for calculation
.TP
.I sha
use the sha algorithm for calculation
.RE
.TP
.B allow_unsigned_uploads
This defines if you are allowed to upload files without a GnuPG
signature to this host or not.
.TP
.B allow_dcut
This defines if you are allowed to upload a dcut changes file to the
queue to remove or move files.
.TP
.B distributions
This defines a comma-separated list of distributions that this host accepts,
used to guess the host to use when none is given on the command line.
.TP
.B allowed_distributions
A regular expression (of Python \fBre\fR module syntax) that the
distribution field must match or dput will refuse the upload.
.TP
.B delayed
Set a numeric default parameter for delayed uploads (i.e. uploads to this
queue will be delayed the specified number of days. Defaults to the
empty string, meaning no delay. This only works with upload queues
that support delayed uploads.
.TP
.B run_lintian
This option defines if lintian should be run before the package will 
be uploaded or not. If the package is not lintian clean, the upload will
not happen.
.TP
.B run_dinstall
This options defines if dinstall \-n should be run after the package has
been uploaded or not. This is an easy way to test if your package would be 
installed into the archive or not.
.TP
.B check_version
This option defines if dput should check if the user has installed the package 
in his system for testing it before putting it into the archive. If the
user has not installed and tested it, dput will reject the upload.
.TP
.B passive_ftp
This option defines if dput should use passive ftp or active ftp for uploading
a package to one of the upload queues. By default, dput uses passive ftp
connections. If you need to use active ftp connections, set
passive_ftp to 0.
.TP
.B progress_indicator
This integer option defines if dput should display a progress indicator for
the upload. (Currently implemented in ftp only.)
.br
Supported values: 0 (default) \- no progress, 1 \- rotating progress
indicator, and 2 \- kilobyte counter.
.TP
.B scp_compress
This option defines if the scp upload to the host will be compressed, or not.
This option is only used for the 'scp' upload method, and has been found to
decrease upload time for slow links, and increase upload times for faster
links.
.TP
.B ssh_config_options
The arguments of this config options should be ssh config file options in
the style documented in \&\fBssh_config\fR\|(5). They will be passed to all
automatic invocations of \fIssh\fR and \fIscp\fR by dput. Note that you can
define multiline (dput) configuration options by indenting the second
line with whitespace (i.e. similar to RFC822 header continuations).
.TP
.B post_upload_command
This option defines a command to be run by dput after a successful upload.
.TP
.B pre_upload_command
This option defines a command to be run by dput before a upload happens.
.TP
.B default_host_main
This defines the default host for packages that are allowed to be uploaded
to the main archive. This variable is used when guessing the host to upload to.
