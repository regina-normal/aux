.SH NAME
.B dput
\- package upload tool for Debian
.SH SYNTAX
.B dput
[\fIoptions\fR]
[\fBhost\fR]
\fBpackage.changes\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a tool for uploading Debian packages into the archive. You may specify
to which host it should upload the file by passing it an
.I host
argument. If omitted, dput uses the host specified by
.I default_host
(or, historically \fIdefault_host_non-us\fR) configuration option.
Also you have to pass the program one or more name of 
.I package.changes
files and then they will be sequentially uploaded.
.P
This program will then upload the package for you into the archive, using a
selected upload method. Currently dput supports ftp, scp, rsync, http,
https, and local. The
method scripts have been split from the main script so it is easy to add
new methods.  Look in /usr/share/dput/ for examples.

Should something go wrong with your upload to destinations using the
Debian upload queue daemon (e.g. ftp-master), you can remove files from
the upload queue with \fBdcut\fP(1).
