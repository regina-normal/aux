Notes for building Debian-based packages
----------------------------------------

- To avoid automatic -dbgsym packages: DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noautodbgsym
- To skip the "make check": DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck
- To finish a build without cleaning first: debuild -nc
- To build a source-only package (required for testing migration): debuild -S
- To build only architecture-dependent binary packages: debuild -B
- To force the .orig.tar.gz to be uploaded (not just the diff): debuild -sa
- To run autopkgtests from the source tree: autopkgtest -B -- null

DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS should be space-separated.

The version of dput contained in this directory is dput-0.9.6.4+deb8u1, taken
from debian jessie.  This is the last dput that was easy to install standalone,
without requiring more complex debian-specific python dependencies.


Setting up Parallels virtual machines
-------------------------------------

Configuration:
- Options / Sharing (nothing but Public/ and Drop Box/)
- Options / Applications (no sharing, just full-screen apps)

Installer notes:
- Debian installer: deselect print server
- Ubuntu: download x.y.0 release from http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/
- Ubuntu installer: minimal install
- Ubuntu installer: disable "download updates while installing"

Disable updates:
- Debian in /etc/apt/sources.list
- Ubuntu via the Software app (-security only, not -updates)

Check for unwanted newer packages:
- Debian/Ubuntu:
  * apt-get install apt-show-versions
  * apt-show-versions | fgrep newer

Desktop tweaks:
- Put Terminal in sidebar
- Disable screen saver
