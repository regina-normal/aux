Notes for building Debian-based packages
----------------------------------------

- To avoid automatic -dbgsym packages: DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noautodbgsym
- To skip the "make check": DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck
- To finish a build without cleaning first: debuild -nc
- To build a source-only package (required for testing migration): debuild -S
- To build only architecture-dependent binary packages: debuild -B
- To force the .orig.tar.gz to be uploaded (not just the diff): debuild -sa
- To run autopkgtests from the source tree: autopkgtest -B -- null

DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS should be space-separated.


Historical Debian packaging
---------------------------

The historical (X.Y.Z) directories hold packaging data for old versions of
Regina:

- In many cases the sid packaging is omitted; this is deliberate, since it
  was a moving target (e.g., following library transitions, and in at least
  one case removing the entire GUI for a period of time during the transition
  from KDE3 to KDE4).  The correct way of addressing this is to remove more
  of the sid/ subdirectories where this is reasonable, rather than trying to
  faithfully reconstruct them.  Note that many of the old sid packages can be
  found online at snapshot.debian.org.

- Before moving to the quilt source format (_partway_ through the very long 5.1
  packaging cycle), the old debian packaging came with a *.diff.gz that patched
  the upstream sources where necessary.  These patches are in the debian
  directory under the name cvs.diff.  Probably it is worth converting these to
  quilt source format where possible.


Setting up Parallels virtual machines
-------------------------------------

Configuration:
- Options / Sharing (nothing but Public/ and Drop Box/)
- Options / Applications (no sharing, just full-screen apps)

Installer notes:
- Debian installer: deselect print server
- Ubuntu: download x.y.0 release from http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/
- Ubuntu installer: minimal install
- Ubuntu installer: disable "download updates while installing"
- Ubuntu kinetic/amd64: desktop install fails at partitioning stage; need to
    go via server install as on arm64
- Ubuntu */arm64:
  + Currently requires a server image from https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/
  + Do not set up LVM groups on the hard drive
  + Do not install server snaps
  + Need to install ubuntu-desktop-minimal after initial install

Configure updates:
- Debian in /etc/apt/sources.list
- Ubuntu via the Software app (-security always, -updates for test machines
  but not build machines; -backports never; not auto-install)

Check for unwanted newer packages:
- Debian/Ubuntu:
  * apt-get install apt-show-versions
  * apt-show-versions | grep newer

Desktop tweaks:
- Put Terminal in sidebar
- Disable screen saver
- On Ubuntu, "snap install snap-store" to get the Ubuntu Software app
