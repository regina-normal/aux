Description: mathematical software for low-dimensional topology
 Regina is a software package for 3-manifold and 4-manifold topologists,
 with a focus on triangulations, normal surfaces and angle structures.
 .
 For 3-manifolds, it includes high-level tasks such as 3-sphere recognition,
 connected sum decomposition and Hakenness testing, comes with a rich
 database of census manifolds, and incorporates the SnapPea kernel for
 working with hyperbolic manifolds.  For 4-manifolds, it offers a range of
 combinatorial and algebraic tools, plus support for normal hypersurfaces.
 .
 Regina comes with a full graphical user interface, as well as Python bindings
 and a low-level C++ programming interface.
 .
 This package includes the graphical user interface and the command-line
 Python interface.  The users' handbook and the API documentation are in
 the separate package regina-normal-doc, and the MPI-enabled utilities for
 high-performance clusters are in the separate package regina-normal-mpi.

Description: development files for Regina, the topology software
 Regina is a software package for low-dimensional topologists.  This package
 provides development files for compiling Regina's mathematical engine into
 other projects.
 .
 The calculation engine is provided as a C++ shared library.  For complete
 API documentation, see the package regina-normal-doc.
 .
 Regina focuses on the study of 3-manifold and 4-manifold triangulations,
 normal surfaces, and angle structures.  For Regina's standard graphical
 user interface, and for more information about what Regina can do, see
 the package regina-normal.

Description: MPI utilities for Regina, the topology software
 Regina is a software package for low-dimensional topologists.  This package
 contains the components of Regina designed to run large parallel computations
 on a high-performance cluster using MPI.
 .
 These components are built against the default implementation of MPI,
 and must be run under the default MPI runtime environment (as found
 in the package mpi-default-bin).
 .
 Regina focuses on the study of 3-manifold and 4-manifold triangulations,
 normal surfaces, and angle structures.  For Regina's standard graphical
 user interface, and for more information about what Regina can do, see
 the package regina-normal.
