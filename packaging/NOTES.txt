To build the source tarball via cmake:

  make package_source

To build debian/ubuntu packages:

  - Building:

    debuild     (on amd64)
    debuild -B  (on i386)

  - Signing on the master build machine:

    ~/git/regina-aux/packaging/debian/debsign-regina *.changes

  - Uploading from the master machine (assumes debian/dput.cf -> ~/.dput.cf):

    /opt/dput/dput regina *.changes  (do this for each debian/ubuntu suite)
    debian/sign-remote.sh <suite>

    Depending on the dput configuration, you might need to run
        "mini-dinstall -b" on the remote machine.  This happens after dput,
        but before sign-remote.
    Every time a new dput run is made, sign-remote must be run.
    Every time a new suite is added, the local sign-remote and the remote
        .mini-dinstall.conf must be edited to include it.

  - More information:

    See debian/NOTES.txt.

To make a MacOS bundle:

  - On the build machine:

    Change into regina-X.Y/ and run path/to/macos/build-mac.

    Check the cmake output to see what is coming from /sw.
    In particular, libpython and libxml2 should come from /usr.
    This may require uninstalling some fink development packages.

  - On the signing machine:

    Change into the macos packaging directory.

    To sign:       ./sign-all path/to/Regina.app
    To make a DMG: ./dmg-maker.py path/to/Regina.app
