Notes for building RPM-based packages
-------------------------------------

This list of notes is simply to help the author build RPM-based packages
for Regina without forgetting anything.

Preparing, building and installing:

  - Check ~/.rpmmacros (rpm --showrc):
      %_topdir /home/bab/rpm
      %_vendor fedora19 (or whatever)
  - Clean out ~/rpm:
      - Subdirs SOURCES, SPECS, BUILD, SRPMS, RPMS
  - Uninstall (rpm -e regina-normal)
  - Build (rpmbuild -ba <spec-file>)
  - Install (rpm -Uvh <rpm-file>)

Note that openSUSE no longer ships with tokyocabinet.
However, you can install it from their experimental repositories:

  zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:libraries:c_c++/openSUSE_Leap_15.2/devel:libraries:c_c++.repo
  zypper refresh
  zypper install libtokyocabinet9 libtokyocabinet-devel

If you are interested in helping package Regina for one or more
distributions, please contact the author at the address below.

Setting up Parallels virtual machines
-------------------------------------

Configuration:
- Options / Sharing (nothing but Public/ and Drop Box/)
- Options / Applications (no sharing, just full-screen apps)

Installer notes:
- openSUSE installer: select KDE plasma desktop
- openSUSE installer: disable online repositories when asked

Disable updates:
- Fedora in /etc/yum.repos.d (set enabled=0 in updates repos)
- openSUSE via yast, then check via "zypper repos"

Check for unwanted newer packages:
- Fedora:
  * Run rpm-versions-fedora, copied from this directory
- openSUSE:
  * zypper refresh
  * zypper packages -r repo-oss -r repo-non-oss -i | grep ^v

Desktop tweaks:
- Fedora: put Terminal in sidebar
- All: disable screen saver (but this does not seem to work for openSUSE)
