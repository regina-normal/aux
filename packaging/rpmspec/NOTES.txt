Notes for building RPM-based packages
-------------------------------------

This list of notes is simply to help the author build RPM-based packages
for Regina without forgetting anything.

Preparing, building and installing:

  - Check ~/.rpmmacros (rpm --showrc):
      %_topdir /home/bab/rpm
      %_vendor fedora19 (or whatever)
  - Clean out ~/rpm:
      - Subdirs SOURCES, SPECS, BUILD, SRPMS, RPMS
  - Uninstall (rpm -e regina-normal)
  - Build (rpmbuild -ba <spec-file>)
  - Install (rpm -Uvh <rpm-file>)

Note that openSUSE no longer ships with tokyocabinet.
However, you can install it from their experimental repositories:

  zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:libraries:c_c++/openSUSE_Leap_15.2/devel:libraries:c_c++.repo
  zypper refresh
  zypper install libtokyocabinet9 libtokyocabinet-devel

If you are interested in helping package Regina for one or more
distributions, please contact the author at the address below.
