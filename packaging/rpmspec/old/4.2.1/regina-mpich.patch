+MPI-Enabled Utilities in Regina
+-------------------------------
+
+The following command-line utilities make use of MPI (the Message
+Passing Interface), which makes them well suited for use on clusters:
+
+- /usr/bin/tricensus-mpi  (form a census of 3-manifold triangulations)
+
+These utilities have been built against the MPICH implementation of MPI.
+This means that they must be run under the MPICH runtime environment
+(and not LAM).  The MPICH runtime environment can be found in the
+package "mpich".
+
+If you have no need for MPI, Regina also ships with non-MPI alternatives
+to the above utilities.
