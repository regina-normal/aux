+MPI-Enabled Utilities in Regina
+-------------------------------
+
+The following command-line utilities make use of MPI (the Message
+Passing Interface), which makes them well suited for use on clusters:
+
+- /usr/bin/tricensus-mpi  (form a census of 3-manifold triangulations)
+
+These utilities have been built against the MPICH implementation of MPI,
+using the ch-p4 device (which works well for heterogeneous clusters).
+This means that they must be run under the MPICH/ch-p4 runtime environment
+(and specifically not under LAM).  The MPICH runtime environments can be
+found in the package "mpich".
+
+If you have no need for MPI, Regina also ships with non-MPI alternatives
+to the above utilities.
