5.1:

This release is a major overhaul for Python users:

– All of the code that was deprecated in version 5.0 has now been removed entirely.  See http://regina-normal.github.io/regina4to5.html for instructions on how to update your scripts.

– Many class names have changed, but most of these changes follow a standard pattern (classes of the form NFoo become Foo).  The old class names have been kept, and will not be removed until Regina 6.0.  See http://regina-normal.github.io/regina5to6.html for details.

– More of Regina's triangulation code is now generic, which means you can do more with higher-dimensional triangulations (e.g., triangulate boundary components, or compute homology).

This release also includes minor enhancements to the mathematics and the user interface (e.g., a Windows menu, better syntax highlighting for script packets, and the ability to cancel long Turaev-Viro calculations).

5.0.1:

Restores syntax highlighting for script packets, which was disabled in the first Mac App Store release of Regina.  Also removes Regina's ancient "Python libraries" facility (which will likewise be removed from other platforms in Regina 5.1).
