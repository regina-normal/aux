<h1><a name="contents">Regina for Debian:  Wheezy (Debian 7.x)</a></h1>

<div class="warning"><p>
<b>Notice: Regina's repository has moved</b>,
as of 31 August 2014.<br><br>
The only difference is that <tt>http</tt> has changed to <tt>https</tt>.<br><br>
Even if you have followed these steps before, you
will need to add the new line to <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>
as described in step&nbsp;2 below.
</p></div>
<p>
Debian 7.x (Wheezy) already comes with Regina, but this is
an <b>old version</b> (4.93).
</p>
<p>
To install the <b>newest version</b> of Regina, follow these instructions.
</p>
<p>
<b>You only need to follow these steps the first time you install Regina.</b>
After this, Debian's package manager will handle upgrades for you,
just like for any other Debian package.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Make Regina's repository a trusted source.  This helps keep your machine
secure, and avoids messages like &ldquo;these packages cannot be
authenticated&rdquo;.
To do this,
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~bab/regina-key.txt">download
 Regina's cryptographic signing key here</a>.
Then, at a command prompt type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo apt-key add ~/Downloads/regina-key.txt</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
Here you should replace <tt>~/Downloads/regina-key.txt</tt> with location of
the file you just downloaded.  You can now delete regina-key.txt if you like.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Add Regina's location to your list of repositories.  To do this, open
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> and add the following line:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>deb https://people.debian.org/~bab/regina wheezy/</tt>
</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Update the list of available packages.  At a command prompt, type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo apt-get update</tt>
</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Install or upgrade Regina like you would any other package.  Type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo apt-get install regina-normal</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
</ol>
<p>
The procedure above only installs the main packages
<tt>regina-normal</tt> and <tt>regina-normal-doc</tt>, which is all that
most people will need.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
If you are a C++ programmer and you wish to build Regina into your own
projects, you should also install the package <tt>regina-normal-dev</tt>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you want the MPI-enabled utilities for use on high-performance clusters,
you should install the package <tt>regina-normal-mpi</tt>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
