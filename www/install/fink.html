<h1><a name="contents">Regina for MacOS X:  Fink Packages</a></h1>
<p>
<b>The good news:</b> Regina runs on MacOS X, and the user experience is
<b>much</b> cleaner and more natural than the old (pre-2011) versions.  See the
<a href="../index.html#screenshots">screenshots</a>,
all of which were taken on my Mac.
</p>
<p>
<b>The bad news:</b> You still need Fink.  Regina is written for GNU/Linux, and
Fink makes the many compile-time and run-time dependencies available for
Mac users.  We are still a long way from a drag-and-drop Mac application.
</p>
<p>
To install Regina, you will need:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><i>MacOS X Leopard (10.5) or Snow Leopard (10.6):</i></p>
<p>
Fink has not yet been fully ported to Lion (10.7), which means neither
has Regina.  The Fink people are working on it, and hopefully Regina
will be available on Lion soon.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>The Apple XCode/Developer Tools:</i></p>
<p>
This gives you a C++ compiler and other tools.  You should find the
Developer Tools on your MacOS X install discs, but you can also
download them from Apple for free.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>A source-based Fink install, including the <tt>unstable</tt> tree:</i></p>
<p>
You need to install Fink as a <b>source distribution</b>, not a binary
distribution.
<a href="http://www.finkproject.org/download/srcdist.php">See here for
instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
You also need to enable the <b>unstable tree</b>.  Run
&ldquo;<tt>fink configure</tt>&rdquo;,
and when it asks you about the <tt>unstable</tt> tree, say yes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>The Fink info file for Regina:</i></p>
<p>
This tells Fink how to build and install Regina.
<a href="fink/regina-normal.info">Download it here</a>,
and copy it into
<tt>/sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/</tt> so that Fink can find it:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ sudo cp regina-normal.info /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo</tt>
</p></div>
</ol>
<p>
Now you can build and install Regina:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure that Fink can see the new version of Regina:</p>
<div class="example"><pre>
example$ fink list regina-normal
Information about 10252 packages read in 1 seconds.
     regina-normal    4.90-0.1     Computational 3-manifold ...
     regina-normal-d  4.4-3        Development files for ...
     regina-normal4.  4.3.1-2      Shared libraries for ...
     ... (lots more output)
</pre></div>
<p>
You will see older versions of Regina as well (these are coming from Fink),
but the <tt>regina-normal</tt> package at the top of the list should show the
new version (4.90-0.1).  If you only see old versions, check that you
copied <tt>regina-normal.info</tt> to the correct location in step 4 above.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build and install Regina as you would any other Fink package:</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ fink install regina-normal</tt>
</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be patient!</p>
<p>
Fink will download and build all of the components that Regina needs,
including the substantial Qt and KDE libraries and all of <i>their</i>
prerequisites.  This may take several hours, and you might want to
leave the build running overnight.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For C++ programmers:</p>
<p>
If you are a C++ programmer and you wish to build Regina into your own
projects, you will also want the Regina development package:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ fink install regina-normal-dev</tt>
</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To run Regina, open the Finder and browse to
<tt>/sw/opt/kde4/mac/bin/regina-kde</tt>
on your hard drive.  You can drag this app onto your dock if you like.
</p>
<p>
That's all!  It takes a while to install, but again the end product looks
and feels much better than Regina ever did on the Mac before.
