This directory contains files for use by the project maintainers, such
as packaging scripts and website material.

Users should not need to check out these files.  Instead:

* For software downloads and data files, see http://regina.sourceforge.net/ .

* For the bleeding-edge source code, check out the main repository at
  http://sourceforge.net/p/regina/git/ .
